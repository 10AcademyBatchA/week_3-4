# Redash chatbot add-on

## LLM based chatbot for Advanced Data Analytics, Visualisation, and Automated Insight Extraction

Our company is seeking to significantly enhance its data analysis capabilities, specifically focusing on comprehensive YouTube data exploration. The aim of this project is to build a novel Redash chat add-on that our team members can use to extract insight from multiple Redash dashboards and from connected databases using natural language. The chat add-on enables a seamless  conversation in a question and answer format and autonomous knowledge discovery.  User queries could be about what is already displayed in the dashboard or questions that require generating SQL query using LLMs to be run against our connected databases. The end-to-end system you will help us build will empower and allow our team members to extract deep, meaningful, and actionable insights from our business intelligence (BI) platforms. 

Our company's BI dashboards are not only to give us monitoring capability of our business process, but also to help us transform the data we collect from multiple systems such as YouTube, Slack and Gmeet into actionable insights that can drive strategic decisions and offer a competitive edge in understanding digital content consumption trends.

The scope of this project extends to developing a Redash add-on in the frontend and an intelligence backend that translates user queries into one of the following 


* Summary of visualisations in the current dashboard
* Insight about data returned by existing SQL queries
* Auto generate SQL queries and visualisations 
* Auto generate new Redash dashboards from existing and auto generated SQL queries and its associated visualisations.
  
This tool will be a game-changer to BI and data analysis using Redash - helping translate natural language queries into complex SQL queries. This functionality is expected to democratize data analytics, allowing team members with non-technical backgrounds to easily extract and visualize data without deep knowledge of SQL. The integration of this add-on with Redash will streamline our analytical processes, making data exploration more accessible, efficient, and user-friendly.

Additionally, the backend API you will develop could be usable in many data analysis and BI projects.
